# StormCape

StormCape is a weather app for Android devices that provides accurate and reliable forecasts for any location in the world. You can easily check the current weather conditions, hourly and daily forecasts, and historical data for your favorite places. StormCape also features a beautiful and intuitive user interface, customizable widgets, and notifications.

## Architecture

StormCape is built with Android Studio using Java as the main programming language. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern and uses Android Jetpack components such as LiveData, ViewModel, Navigation, Room, WorkManager, and Data Binding. The app also uses Retrofit and Gson for network communication, Glide for image loading, and Dagger Hilt for dependency injection.

## API Documentation

StormCape uses the [OpenWeather API](^2^) to fetch weather data from various sources. The API provides current weather data, 5-day/3-hour forecasts, and historical data for more than 200,000 cities. To use the API, you need to register for a free account and obtain an API key. You can find more information about the API and its usage on the [official website](^2^).

## Design

StormCape follows the [Material Design](^3^) guidelines for Android apps. The app uses a dark theme with blue accents to create a pleasant and immersive user experience. The app also supports adaptive icons, animations, and transitions. The design mockups for the app are available on [Figma](^4^).
